### Hello from the past, Future Time Traveler! ðŸ‘‹
I'm DB and I made my first website in the late 90's with [AOL Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOLpress) and hosted it on [AOL Hometown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_Hometown). Since then, I've learned a great deal about [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext), the greatest invention of the 20th century. I still build end-to-end web applications mostly in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), sometimes in [PHP](https://www.php.net/).

Some of the more interesting open-source projects I've created or worked on:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
  - [RSS Reader](https://chickar.ee/) ([source](https://github.com/chickaree))
