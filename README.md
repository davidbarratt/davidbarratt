### Hello from the past, Future Time Traveler! ðŸ‘‹
I'm DB and I made my first website in the late 90's with [AOLpress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOLpress) and hosted it on [AOL Hometown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_Hometown). Since then, I've learned a great deal about [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext), the greatest invention of the 20th century. I still build full-stack end-to-end web applications mostly in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), sometimes in [PHP](https://www.php.net/).

Some of the more interesting open-source projects I've created or worked on:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
  - [RSS Reader](https://chickar.ee/) ([source](https://github.com/chickaree))
  - [Movie Showtime Finder](https://cinematix.app/) ([source](https://github.com/cinematix-app))
  - [COVID Ratio](https://covidratio.pages.dev/) ([source](https://github.com/covidratio/covidratio))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - [MediaWiki Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mediawiki) ([source](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-docker))
  - [Phabricator Image](https://hub.docker.com/u/phabricator/) ([source](https://github.com/phabricator-docker/phabricator))
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
  - [Microsoft OneDrive CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/onedrivejs) ([source](https://github.com/onedrivejs/onedrive))
